There are snakes, snakes, snakes, 
Big as garden rakes,
At the store! At the store! 
There are snakes, snakes, snakes, 
Big as garden rakes, at the Quartermaster's store.

Chorus:
My eyes are dim I can-not see. 
I have not got my specs with me. 
I have HEY! Not HO! got my specs with me.

There are mice, mice, mice,
Running though the rice,
At the store! At the store! 
There are mice, mice, mice, 
Running through the rice, at the Quartermaster's store.

Chorus

There are ants, ants, ants,
Hidden in the plants,
At the store! At the store!
There are ants, ants, ants,
Hidden in the plants, at the Quartermaster's store.

Chorus

There are geese, geese, geese,
Huddled in the fleece,
At the store! At the store!
There are geese, geese, geese,
Huddled in the fleece, at the Quartermaster's store.

Chorus

There are cats, cats, cats,
Wearing fuzzy hats,
At the store! At the store!
There are cats, cats, cats,
Wearing fuzzy hats, at the Quartermaster's store.
